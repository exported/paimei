it seems that with a bp at 3d94, arg0 = 0 which is bad.  Not sure why
no, actually, the copy of arg0 to edi doesn't happen.
no, actually, I fucked up the get/set context of edi... need to start over to see the problem.

(gdb) x/16i 0x3d94
0x3d94:	push   ebp
0x3d95:	mov    ebp,esp
0x3d97:	push   edi
0x3d98:	push   esi
0x3d99:	push   ebx
0x3d9a:	sub    esp,0x4c
0x3d9d:	mov    edi,DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8]
0x3da0:	mov    edx,DWORD PTR ds:0x16214
0x3da6:	mov    eax,DWORD PTR [edi+0x4c]


check out the try statement in is_address...  use test and test7.py to find it.
